# Day-Planner-Schedule

This took me a long time to work on due to being older code that I began writing in the beginning of my bootcamp. After rewriting it and updating it to make it more streamlined I realized that a lot of it wasn't very efficient and wasn't very clean so I went back to the drawing board with what I have learned recently.

The weekday planner now will set according to the current date and time and will save to local storage when used. The updated time should also change colors when logged and set.

# Future-Improvements

I would like to add reminders to the planner to notify the user ahead of time that can be manually set. Possibly add working links to other webpages and have a bigger breakdown of the time and schedule.
